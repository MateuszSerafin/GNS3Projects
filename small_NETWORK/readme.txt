Not sure what i want to point out in this network.
This network is done on static routes. I did not do OSPF so it's really basic
The only thing i am suprised is connecting LACP with windows it works it's really easy to do. 

Another issue is that i have outdated images in gns3 so the vpn is using ikev1. 

#TODO ADD CONFIGS for each device there
