This repo is for my GNS3 projects.

Folder ending with _NETWORK as name suggest is a network topology that i created/used.
I will reuse VM's between networks and keep track of what i did therefore a folder ending with _VM is a folder containg some information what this VM does. 
Also there is folder resources which are mostly for me to remind my self of how i did something in future in case i need it.
